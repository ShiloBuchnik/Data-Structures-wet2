# Data-Structures-wet2
### In this assignment we implemented and used a dynamic hash table, Union-Find structure and an AVL rank tree


We were assigned to create a DS that will keep track of a fixed amount of companies, and their employees.  
The Union-Find is used to store companies, and manage acquisition of companies (essentially a Union).  
The dynamic hash table is used to store employees of each company.  
The rank tree also stores employees, and is used for retrieving data of employees by rank.  

1. `'Comapny.cpp/h'` and `'Employee.cpp/h'` define and implement a company and employee classes.
2. `'CompanyUnion.h'`, `'EarnerRankTree.cpp/h'`, `'EmployeeHash.cpp/h'` define and implement the aforementioned data structures.
3. `'EmployeeManager.h/cpp'` define and implement the assigned functions.
4. The other files were given by the course's staff.
